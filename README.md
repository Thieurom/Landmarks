# Landmarks

A rebuild of Apple's [__Landmarks__](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) using the [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

## Motivation
The [Landmarks](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) is the official tutorial since Apple first introduced SwiftUI in WWDC 19 and has been frequently updated since then. For developers who want to learn how to build SwiftUI apps with the Composable Architecture–_a library that provides tools for building applications with a focus on composability, modularity, and testability_, rebuilding it with the library would be a great introduction :pray:

The application is built in modularized style. It allows us to work on features without building the entire application, which improves compile times and SwiftUI preview stability. Each feature also is accompanied by a test suite.

This project is also inspired by [standups](https://github.com/pointfreeco/standups)–a rebuild of Apple's "Scrumdinger" application–by the authors of the Composable Architecture.
